- 🏫 I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Business Analytics. I **graduated in December of 2021! **
- 🟢 I'm currently **looking out for full time opportunities as a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist**. 
- 📝 I'm currently working on an article to show how I would justify the use of machine learning for a problem. Its structured like a design doc and not in the usual format of an       article. You can checkout the unfinished piece [here](https://medium.com/@kavin.veerapandian/before-thinking-machine-learning-7730c63a861d)
